- What are the key features of the application? Are these clearly separated into their own files, classes, and/or modules?

The key features are
    - Clean source text
    - Tokenize source text
    - Generate tokens distribution
    - Generate a random word given a distribution
    - Generate a sentence given a distribution
    - Compile all of the above features into a web page

- Are the names of files, modules, functions, and variables appropriate and accurate? Would a new programmer be able to understand the names without too much contextual knowledge?

Yes (maybe change variable name)

- What are the scopes of variables and are they appropriate for their use case? If there are global variables, why are they needed?

yes.
Global histogram because I don't want to recreate the histogram every time.

- Are the functions small and clearly specified, with as few side effects as possible?

yes

- Are there functions that could be better organized in an Object-Oriented Programming style by defining them as methods of a class?
- Can files be used as both modules and as scripts?

Yes they can.

- Do modules all depend on each other or can they be used independently?
